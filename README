# Dockerfile for Solr + sunspot_solr

If you are in the unenviable position of having to use the sunspot_solr gem to
hook up your ruby app with solr, this Dockerfile might help.

It copies the necessary schema.xml and solrconfig.xml files out of the gem and
injects them into the correct place in the offical solr:6 container (still
using 6 because that's what I need)

(This sounds easy but finding the right place to put these XML files is not)

Creates config for test, development, staging, and production environments.

## How to use

after building, and getting this up and running, you need to create the cores. This can
only be done while solr is running and thus not in the Dockerfile itself. Luckily this
is easily accomplished with a GET request. Eg, using curl:

    ENV=test \
    curl "http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/cores?action=CREATE&name=$ENV&instanceDir=$ENV"
