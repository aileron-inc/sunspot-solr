# Dockerfile for Solr + sunspot_solr

If you are in the unenviable position of having to use the sunspot_solr gem to
hook up your ruby app with solr, this Dockerfile might help.

It copies the necessary schema.xml and solrconfig.xml files out of the gem and
injects them into the correct place in the offical solr:6 container (still
using 6 because that's what I need)

(This sounds easy but finding the right place to put these XML files is not)

Creates config for test, development, staging, and production environments.

## Memo

docker run -p 8983:8983 --name sunspot aileron/sunspot-solr
docker build -t aileron/sunspot-solr .
docker exec -it sunspot bash

docker stop $(docker ps -q)
docker rm $(docker ps -q -a)
docker rmi $(docker images -q)
